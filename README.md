Simple group chat application made using python sockets. It works on any operating system with Python installed. To get started, clone the repository or download the files manually.
To run the server, open the command line and enter python server.py <any_loopback_ip> (or python3 for Linux). Then, clients can join the chat by running python client.py <same_ip_used_for_server> <same_port>.
